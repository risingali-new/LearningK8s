# Session 00: Prerequisites And 30-Session Roadmap

This is the entry point for the complete Kubernetes guide.

Use this session to prepare the environment, then follow Sessions 01-30 in
order. Existing hands-on labs have been moved into the new sequence instead of
being left in the older topic order.

## Prerequisites

- Basic Linux command line comfort.
- Basic Docker image and container knowledge.
- AWS CLI v2 installed and configured.
- `eksctl` installed.
- `kubectl` installed.
- An AWS IAM user or role that can create EKS, EC2, VPC, IAM, EBS, and load
  balancer resources.

Confirm AWS access:

```bash
aws sts get-caller-identity
```

Confirm tools:

```bash
aws --version
eksctl version
kubectl version --client
docker version
```

## Session Format

Each session README gives the main learning path, and the `subsessions/`
folders break that path into teachable blocks. Sub-session READMEs include the
goal, app-based lab command, checks, cleanup, and review prompts. When a topic
depends on an external controller, CRD, cloud integration, or real domain, the
example manifest stays close to the training app but uses placeholders that must
be replaced in a live cluster.

## Learning Flow

The order is intentional:

1. Learn the control plane and core objects.
2. Learn how Pods run, receive config, and expose traffic.
3. Learn workload controllers and persistent state.
4. Learn ingress, scheduling, resources, and autoscaling.
5. Learn identity, security, secrets, networking, and observability.
6. Learn packaging, GitOps, policy, operators, mesh, operations, and delivery.
7. Finish with a capstone that combines the production concerns.

## Review Questions

1. Why should architecture come before advanced troubleshooting?
2. Why should scheduling come before node autoscaling?
3. Why should RBAC come before controllers, operators, and Argo CD production use?
4. Which sessions need extra controllers or cloud account values before running
   the app-based examples?
